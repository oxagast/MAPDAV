Edited/optimized/sliced'n'diced a ton of code.

7/20/09
Now defaults to the file passwd in whatever directory
you are in, instead of /etc/passwd because that causes
problems on windows systems that don't have a passwd
file.  Fixed regex so shutdown won't show up.  Added
support for any directory name you want so it won't
clobber other runs.  Fixed the user- bug.

Windows compatability fixed (tested on strawberry perl).
Efficiency code cleanup, runs about 3x faster now.

Put in the "[rev]" modifier.

Lots of changes since I started the project, but 
the real changelog begins here because I didn't really 
keep track of what exactly all I changed as I went.
